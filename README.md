# PC_Info
Tool used to generate PC Info and test network issues, by simply clicking a .bat file.

The best way to run this script would be to store it in a specific directory and have a shortcut link on the desktop that someone can click to launch it. Also I'd recommend you have the shortcut make the screen go fullscreen so they can see the entire output.

This tool was created for POS Stations and Tablets that don't have keyboards. For support we were able to navigate the client to the desktop and tell them to click a smiley face. If the screen turned Red, we knew the internet wasn't working on the tablet or either the entire building was down. If it was black with goldish text, we knew the DNS was down. If it came back Green, we knew the internet was working and they could then tell us the info on that device for us to remote into.

Modify this script however you want, I hope it makes your life easier like it did for me and my team.

Enjoy,
JoeyFun
